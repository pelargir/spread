= spread

Makes it easy to add tell-a-friend functionality to any Rails app.


== Installation

Install the gem directly:

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
  sudo gem install pelargir-spread
  
Or install the gem in your Rails project as a plugin:
  
  script/plugin install git://github.com/pelargir/spread.git

Or clone the project:

  git clone git://github.com/pelargir/spread.git


== Usage

Use spread's view helper to embed a link on the page you want to share:

  <%= spread :something %>

Let your controller know you're using spread:

  class SomeController < ActionController::Base
    spread :something
  end

That's all there is to it! (Spread's templates are currently static.
I'm working on making them overrideable so expect that soon.)
